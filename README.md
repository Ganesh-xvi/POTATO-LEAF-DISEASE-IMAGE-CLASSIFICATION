## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to develop a potato plant disease classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system should accurately classify images of potato plants into different disease categories.

## Brief Description

This case study focuses of deep learning techniques for the classification of potato diseases based on plant images. The objective is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can automatically identify and classify different potato diseases. By leveraging deep learning, this study aims to provide a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural experts to detect and manage potato diseases, leading to improved crop yields and reduced losses. The case study covers the dataset used, the deep learning methodology employed, and the evaluation of the developed classification model.

## Scope

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification using CNN and built a model. After deploy the model will tell you if the plant has a disease or not.

## Project Pipeline

- Data collection 
- Model building 
- Regularization 
- Earlystop, Dropout 
- Model evaluation
- Predication on Test Image
## Conclusion

The CNN model for potato disease classification represents a crucial step forward in supporting potato farmers in mitigating financial losses and preventing crop failures. By accurately identifying and classifying diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight, the model equips farmers with valuable insights and empowers them to make informed decisions, fostering sustainable and profitable potato farming practices.
